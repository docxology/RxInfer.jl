# Who's on First: Mountain Car Edition

Abbott: Say Costello, I've been meaning to tell you about this fascinating new project we're working on at the ballpark.

Costello: Oh yeah? What's that?

Abbott: It's called Mountain Car Active Inference.

Costello: Mountain Car? At a baseball park? What are you, nuts?

Abbott: No no, it's a simulation. We've got two agents trying to get up the hill.

Costello: Two agents? Like baseball agents?

Abbott: No, one's Active Inference and one's Naive.

Costello: Well that's naive of them both! Who's controlling them?

Abbott: Exactly! Who's controlling the Active agent, What's controlling the Naive agent, and I Don't Know is measuring the performance metrics.

Costello: Wait a minute... Who's controlling the Active agent?

Abbott: Yes, precisely!

Costello: I mean the fella's name!

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The agent controlling the car!

Abbott: Who is controlling the Active Inference agent.

Costello: That's what I'm asking YOU!

Abbott: And I'm telling you Who is controlling the Active Inference agent.

Costello: Look, let me start over. When you run the simulation, who plots the results?

Abbott: Oh no, Who doesn't plot anything. What plots the results.

Costello: I'm not asking what plots the results!

Abbott: What does plot the results. Creates beautiful heatmaps too.

Costello: I don't care about heatmaps! I want to know who's plotting!

Abbott: No no, Who's controlling, not plotting.

Costello: *exasperated* Then who IS plotting?

Abbott: No, like I said, What plots everything.

Costello: Alright wise guy, let me try another way. The car needs to get up the hill, right?

Abbott: Right.

Costello: So who calculates the force needed?

Abbott: No, Who only handles Active Inference. I Don't Know calculates the forces.

Costello: You don't know who calculates the forces?

Abbott: No, I Don't Know calculates the forces!

Costello: That's what I'm asking you!

Abbott: And that's what I'm telling you - I Don't Know calculates the forces!

Costello: *pulling hair out* THEN WHO DOES?

Abbott: No! Who does Active Inference! I Don't Know does forces, What does plotting, and Tomorrow handles the parameter sweep!

Costello: Parameter sweep? You're bringing in a groundskeeper now?

Abbott: No no, Tomorrow is our batch simulation handler. Today's not involved at all.

Costello: How can you run simulations if Today's not involved?

Abbott: Why would you want Today involved?

Costello: I'm not asking why!

Abbott: Oh, Why's busy analyzing the energy consumption.

Costello: *slumps* I don't even know what we're talking about anymore...

Abbott: That's the spirit! Now you're getting it! I Don't Know is a crucial part of our implementation!

Costello: AAAAAGH! *storms off*

Abbott: *calling after him* Hey, wait! I haven't told you about Because's statistical significance testing yet!

*Later that day...*

Costello: *returns cautiously* Okay, let me just ask one simple thing.

Abbott: Sure!

Costello: In the config file, who sets the initial position?

Abbott: Oh no, Naturally sets the initial position.

Costello: ...naturally?

Abbott: Yes, Naturally.

Costello: *walks away muttering* I should've stayed in the minor leagues...

Abbott: *shouting* Don't forget practice Tomorrow! We're running a full parameter sweep!

Costello: *distant screaming*
